# PhishGuardAI - Phishing URL Detection

A machine learning-powered web application to detect and classify phishing URLs.

## Setup

### Initial Setup

Before running the application, generate the ML models:

1. **Navigate to the notebooks directory:**
   ```bash
   cd notebooks/
   ```

2. **Run the training notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook phishing_detection_training.ipynb
   ```
   Execute all cells to generate the model files in `/backend/app/models/`

### Running the Application

Start the application with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This will:
- Build and start the backend (FastAPI) on http://localhost:4000
- Build and start the frontend (React) on http://localhost:8080

## Features

- URL feature extraction and analysis
- ML-based phishing detection
- REST API for predictions
- Interactive web interface

## Important Notes

- **ML Model Files**: The `backend/app/models/` directory contains generated model files that are NOT tracked in git. These must be regenerated using the training notebook when setting up a fresh environment.
- See `backend/app/models/README.md` for details on generating models.
